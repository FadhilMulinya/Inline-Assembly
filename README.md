# **Smart Contracts for Learning Inline Assembly**

This repository contains a set of Solidity smart contracts designed to help you learn and understand **inline assembly**. Inline assembly allows you to write low-level EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) code directly within Solidity, providing fine-grained control over gas usage and storage manipulation.

---

## **What is Inline Assembly?**

Inline assembly is a way to write low-level EVM opcodes directly in Solidity. It is useful for:
- Optimizing gas usage.
- Accessing storage and memory directly.
- Performing complex operations that are not easily expressible in high-level Solidity.

**Note**: Inline assembly bypasses Solidity's safety checks, so it should be used with caution.

## **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Solidity and Ethereum smart contracts.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher).
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for local development and testing.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:FadhilMulinya/Inline-Assembly.git
   cd Inline-Assembly
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   forge install
   ```

### Usage
1. Compile the contracts:
   ```bash
   forge compile
   ```
   or
    ```bash
   forge build
   ```
